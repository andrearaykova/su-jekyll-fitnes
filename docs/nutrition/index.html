            </header>
            <p>Whether your goal is to gain muscle mass, burn fat, improve performance or maintain weight for a
                particular sport, the most important piece of the food puzzle is to regulate your energy intake
                properly.
                People usually have one goal in mind - to reduce fat or increase muscle mass - although everyone wants
                both.
                To create an energy deficit or excess, a change in diet should be used, not exercise manipulation.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When people in the industry talk about macronutrients, they mean three types of macronutrients:
            carbohydrates, proteins and fats. You may have heard them say that while energy balance determines whether
            weight increases or decreases, macronutrients determine whether this change is in fat or muscle mass.</p>

        <p>“Micro” because of quantities: While macro elements are generally calculated in grams, microelements are
            generally calculated in milligrams (or even smaller units).
            Think of macronutrients as gas in your car, which gives it energy to power the engine. Micronutrients are
            oils and lubricants that help keep your car from getting damaged.</p>

            It's important to keep that in mind, because at the very beginning of the series, I mentioned that
            compliance is the most important factor in all of this - the best diet is the one you can follow - so think
            carefully about the additional complications of dealing with every step of your ability to adhere to it.
            And by no means feel obligated to adhere to all of them.</p>
